# Bible API

A web API that can retrieve scripture passages from the Bible

It's far from perfect. But here's how you use it:
* Clone a copy with 
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/WinstonMarvel/bibleAPI/
  ```
* Install dependencies
  ```javascript 
    npm-install
  ```
* Install dependencies
  ```javascript 
    npm-install
  ```
* Send a GET Request to the host with `/api/` followed by the chapter and optionally the verse. Example:\
  Sending a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/psalm/23` should return the chapter in JSON
